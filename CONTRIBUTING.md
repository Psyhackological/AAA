# Contribution Guidelines

## Issues
__If I've made mistake, notify me on the Issues page or throw me a pull request.__

## Pull requests - steps to follow:
1. Check if the app is missing on the list.
2. Check the rules and follow them.
3. Test yet again the app on your Android smartphone.
4. Fork the project and follow this format:

### Contents:
```
### Contents:
- [Category Name](#category-name)
```

### The list:
- I prefer svg over png icons because it is vector and weights less.
- When searching for an app's icon in a repo, look for: `svg`, `icon.png` or `ic_launcher.png`.
- If F-Droid link is not available, please replace `F-Droid` with `IzzyOnDroid` link if possible.

```
## Category Name
### App Name
<img alt="AppName" height="64" src="AppNameImageLink.svg/png">

- [x] [Google Play](GooglePlayLink)
- [x] [F-Droid](F-DroidLink)
- [x] [Source code](SourceCodeLink)
- [x] [Official page](OfficialPageLink)
```
__Note that in img's alt there is no spaces at all.__

If something is missing replace `x` with `space` and remove `[](link)`.

Change `Source code` to only one main source code repository link please, not the mirror one.

5. Check your spelling.
6. Check if app in the list is in alphabetical order.
7. Update the app counter.
8. Paste changed template for each app:
``` markdown
## AppName
- [x] Installed and tested by me on my main smartphone and used for about 15 minutes or more.
- [x] Has dark theme.
- [x] It has x trackers on [εxodus](εxodus report link).
- [x] It has x F-Droid [Anti-Features](F-Droid / IzzyOnDroid link).
- [x] I use the app on a daily basis and I love almost the entirety of it, so I placed next to it a heart.
```
Replace `x` and `links` with your data about the app.

9. Make a pull request and wait for my response.
