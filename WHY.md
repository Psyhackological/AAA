# Why does it exist?

### I created this repo because: 
1. I wanted to create something on my own.
1. Other list's are just boring plain text that are very generic (AppName - description).
1. Most of them are outdated.
1. I share useful niche apps that are hard to find, and help creators mantain their hard work.
1. To improve my MarkDown proficiency.
